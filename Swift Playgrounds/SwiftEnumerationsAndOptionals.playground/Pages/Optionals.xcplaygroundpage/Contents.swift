/*
 Challenge Task 1 of 1
 
 In the editor, you have a pretty complex dictionary representing a movie. It contains a nested dictionary, which itself contains an array of Strings as a value.
 
 Your job is to assign the string containing the value for the lead actor (which for the sake of the example is at position 0 in the array) to the variable leadActor.
 
 Since dictionaries return optional values, you will have to use an if let statement to unwrap each consecutive operation.
*/

let movieDictionary = ["Spectre": ["cast": ["Daniel Craig", "Christoph Waltz", "LÃ©a Seydoux", "Ralph Fiennes", "Monica Bellucci", "Naomie Harris"]]]

var leadActor: String = ""

if let movieActor = movieDictionary["Spectre"],
    let cast = movieActor["cast"] {
    leadActor = cast[0]

/* Code Challenge
 in the editor, you have a struct named Book which has few stored properties, two of which are optional.
 
 Your task is to create a failable initializer that accepts a dictionary as input and initializes all the stored properties. (Hint: A failable init method is one that can return nil and is written as init?). Name the initializer parameter dict.
 
 Use the following keys to retrieve values from the dictionary: "title", "author", "price", "pubDate"
 
 */

    let title: String
    let author: String
    let price: String?
